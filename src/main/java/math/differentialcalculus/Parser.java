 *
 * The first command means the function, sin(x) is to be differentiated wrt x,

 * The second command means the function, sin(x) is to

 * The third command means that a function called y has been pre-defined. The parser will load the

 * parser will load the function and differentiate it wrt x, twice, and then
 * evaluate it at x = 5.
